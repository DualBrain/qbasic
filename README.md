# QBASIC

*SUMMARY:*
QBASIC as written or pilaged by an 11yo in 1999

> QB64 is a modern extended BASIC programming language that retains QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5 compatibility and compiles native binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS

_DISCLAIMER: The spaghetti code contained in this repo was most likely written by me, but anything half decent was probably pillaged and plundered from an amalgam of books. I didn't have much internet access then, so it was likely not taken from anything that was available online. All typos, errors, and syntax atrocities are the author's own responsibility._

I am indebted to Mr Smith, whose first name I cannot remember but whose face I won't forget. As 11-year-olds in 1999, a friend and I were incredibly bored in IT classes. Mr Smith let us sit in a corner and spend our classes playing with QBASIC. If my memory serves me, our labs had Windows NT. We were initially exposed to the TI-83 calculators that were reserved for the year 12 students, but he believed that it was important that students get used to them early so that when the time came when we needed them, we could be masters.

Our love of making small programmes in TI-BASIC meant that he opened the world of QBASIC to us. At the time it was not as apparent the impact that technology would have on our lives, and it was rare to be encouraged in this way.

Thank you, Mr Smith.
