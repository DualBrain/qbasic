# QBASIC

The is a project that will strive to create a fully-functioning and accurate replacement to the last available version of Microsoft QBasic (v1.1); that is native to Windows, Linux (Debian) and possibly other modern operating systems/platforms as well as any other necessary changes to support these environments. With that said, the goal is to attempt to achieve as close to 100% the overall UI experience and source-compatibility as well as any possible stability and performance improvements.

As such, during phase one of this project, any features and suggestions that would contribute to scope-creep will be responded to accordingly; until phase one is complete the objectives are clear and no additional features that are outside of phase one scope will be entertained/accepted.

If you'd like to discuss this project in more of real-time environment, you can find me hanging out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AYcgDwERUU) or, slightly less real-time, over on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gotbasic). I will also make any videos available (as the project evolves) over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@gotbasic).

This project also requires additional code found [here](https://github.com/DualBrain/vbPixelGameEngine).
